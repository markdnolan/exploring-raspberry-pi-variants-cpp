# exploring-raspberry-pi-variants-cpp
Self keyed versions of c++ code from book Exporing raspberry Pi by Derek Molloy

Although I keyed this code myself, so that I could get practice and a better underestanding
this code is based almost entirely on the work of Derek Molloy in his excellent book
"Exploring Raspberry Pi" (highly recommended).

The only changes done by me were to add minor enhancements where I felt confident, 
where changes in Rasparian since the book required tweaks, 
or where the configuration of my RPi, such as, superuser rights meant the original
code didn't work
